iTunes Store: Top Movies,2020-10-26T13:06:43-07:00,"Trump Card (2020) - Dinesh D'Souza, Bruce Schooley & Debbie D'souza",https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/trump-card-2020/id1531547328?uo=2,"A specter is haunting America—the specter of socialism. At first glance, this seems incredible. The twentieth century is seen as the century in which capitalism defeated socialism. Socialist regimes collapsed around the world. Today socialism is confined to failing societies such as Cuba, North Korea, and Venezuela. Yet leading candidates and media figures are enthusiastic about moving America toward socialism. They have a raft of proposals for doing this: Medicare for all, universal basic income, free college, and the Green New Deal. This movie will expose the ideology and tactics of the new socialism. It will explain the temptation of socialism—an age of abundance in which we all get something for nothing—and show why the socialist society is a mirage. Socialism produces deprivation, conformity, and tyranny. More than a critique of socialism, the movie will also make a moral defense of capitalism and show how capitalism, not socialism, is the best way to have prosperity and social justice. Narrated by Dinesh D’Souza and featuring eye-opening interviews, dramatic recreations, and comical animated illustrations, this film will be a timely, riveting, and entertaining look at the biggest issue dividing America today."
